### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the responsive implementation to use TailwindCSS utilities, so that the design system remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing responsive design THEN only TailwindCSS utility classes SHALL be used
2. WHEN breakpoints are defined THEN they SHALL follow TailwindCSS standard breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
